# TDIS

The Tagged Deep Inelastic Scattering (TDIS) experiment will probe the mesonic (pion-cloud) component 
of the nucleonâ€”a key to understanding its structure. It will run in Hall A at Thomas Jefferson Lab, 
using the Super BigBite Spectrometer together with  GEM-based radial time-projection chamber.

### ACTS

ACTS is an experiment-independent toolkit for (charged) particle track reconstruction
in high energy and nuclear physics experiments implemented in modern C++.
The ACTS project provides high-level track reconstruction modules that can be used for any tracking detector.
The tracking detector geometry description is optimized for efficient navigation
and fast extrapolation of tracks. In addition to the algorithmic code, this project also provides
an event data model for the description of track parameters and measurements.

### JANA2

JANA2 is a developed at Jefferson Lab C++ framework for multi-threaded HENP event reconstruction.
It is efficient at multi-threading with a design that makes it easy for less experienced programmers
to contribute pieces to the larger reconstruction project. The same JANA2 program can be used 
do partial or full reconstruction, maximizing the available cores for the current job. 
Run on a laptop for local code development, but to also be highly efficient when deploying to local farms or large computing sites like [NERSC](http://www.nersc.gov/ ":target=_blank").
